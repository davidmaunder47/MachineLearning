# MachineLearning -KNN & Naives Bayes

This folder uses KNN & Naives Bayes Classifiers to train and distinguish between real and fake news, based on the article's headline. This code will work with any headline, but it will need to be formatted to work with a custom headline. To run the code just pull the folder from Github and import the dependencies. The KNN and Naive Bayes Classifer will show the Precision, Recall and F1 Scores based on a test(titled Dev) dataset. The two datasets (Train, Dev(test)) are scraped from the web and are broken up evenly into their respective folders. Each dataset will comprise two seperate Fake and Real headlines so the algorithms can be trained and tested on both headlines.
